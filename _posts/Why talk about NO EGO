A while ago, I was watching a foreign interview video where someone mentioned the book that had the greatest impact on them: Ego Is Enemy. Since there aren't many Chinese translations of this book available domestically, I searched for an English e-book version overseas and used the DeepSeek plugin to translate the entire book with bilingual comparison.

That API integration model - honestly, using DeepSeek costs money, and translating the entire book cost me over 1 RMB. But DeepSeek's translation quality is really incomparable to ordinary translation tools. The language fluency is excellent. It should be very helpful for learning both Chinese and English.

When translated into Chinese, it actually seems quite ordinary, but now I can understand that some phrases, when carefully pondered, reveal their original meaning.

However, after translation, it becomes rather ordinary. From a Chinese perspective, foreign language expressions often lack a certain literary beauty. But the depth of the principles requires repeated understanding.

I first encountered the term "ego" a few years ago at ByteDance, where they emphasize "less ego." Ego carries a meaning of self-importance, so "less ego" means "don't be so self-centered."

Initially, my understanding and feelings about ego weren't that profound - I thought it just meant self-importance. At ByteDance, they call it "small ego," meaning you need to be able to listen to others' opinions.

This book Ego Is Enemy kept recurring in my mind for quite some time. Until one day when I was reading the Diamond Sutra, a thought suddenly emerged: "ego is enemy, no ego no enemy." If the self is the enemy, then without self wouldn't it mean: without self, there are no enemies?
