# Ego Is Enemy: From Translation to Enlightenment

> A philosophical journey through translation, corporate culture, and Buddhist wisdom

## The Discovery of a Transformative Book

A while ago, while watching a foreign interview, I discovered a book that had profoundly impacted the interviewee: **Ego Is Enemy**. Finding no Chinese translation readily available, I sought out the English e-book and used DeepSeek's API to translate it with bilingual comparison .

The cost was surprisingly minimal - just over 1 RMB for the entire book - but the translation quality was exceptional. The fluency and natural language processing far surpassed conventional translation tools, making it incredibly valuable for both understanding the content and improving my English comprehension.

## The Translation Paradox

What struck me most was the **translation paradox**: while the Chinese version appeared ordinary on the surface, certain phrases revealed deeper meanings upon careful reflection. The literary beauty I expected was somewhat lost in translation, yet the philosophical depth emerged more clearly with repeated reading and contemplation.

This experience highlighted how cultural concepts carry nuances that often get lost between languages, yet their core wisdom remains accessible to those willing to sit with the text patiently.

## Ego in Corporate Culture: The ByteDance Experience

I first encountered the concept of "ego" in a professional context at **ByteDance**, where "less ego" or "small ego" (低自我) is a fundamental cultural principle . Initially, I understood this simply as not being self-centered - being open to others' opinions and feedback.

ByteDance's approach to "small ego but big picture" (ego小但格局大) represents a sophisticated organizational philosophy. As explained in their internal materials, "ego creates blind spots" - the larger our ego, the more it obstructs our vision and limits our growth potential .

## The Philosophical Breakthrough

For quite some time, the concept of "Ego Is Enemy" lingered in my mind without full resolution. Then, while reading the **Diamond Sutra** (《金刚经》), I experienced a sudden insight: "ego is enemy, no ego no enemy" .

This revelation connected the book's message with the Buddhist concept of "no-self" (无我). If ego is the enemy, then the absence of ego means having no enemy. This echoes the wisdom that true power comes from overcoming our attachment to self-importance.

## The Zen Parallel: Two Levels of Understanding

This intellectual journey reminds me of the famous Zen dialogue between Shenxiu and Huineng:

**Shenxiu's perspective:**
> "The body is the Bodhi tree,  
> The mind is like a clear mirror stand.  
> Time and again brush it clean,  
> Let no dust alight."

**Huineng's enlightenment:**
> "Bodhi is fundamentally without any tree;  
> The bright mirror is also not a stand.  
> Fundamentally there is not a single thing—  
> Where could any dust be attracted?"

My understanding of "ego" underwent a similar transformation - from seeing it as something to be managed (brushing the dust) to recognizing its fundamental emptiness (no mirror to dust).

## Practical Implications

This philosophical understanding has concrete applications:

| Level of Understanding | Practical Application |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Initial**: Ego as self-importance | Listen to others' opinions, be open to feedback |
| **Intermediate**: Ego as obstacle | Practice humility in aspirations, grace in success, resilience in failure  |
| **Advanced**: No ego, no enemy | Transcend dualistic thinking, respond to challenges without personal attachment |

## Conclusion: The Continuous Practice

The journey with *Ego Is Enemy* continues to unfold. What began as a simple translation project has become a ongoing practice in self-awareness. The book's wisdom, particularly when combined with Eastern philosophy, offers a powerful framework for navigating both personal and professional challenges.

The ultimate insight might be that the enemy was never out there - it was the "I" that perceives itself as separate. When that illusion dissolves, so does the conflict.
